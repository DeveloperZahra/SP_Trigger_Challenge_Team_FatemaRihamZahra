1.  What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that perform a specific task, stored in the database for reuse.
They can accept input parameters, return output parameters, and include programming constructs like loops and conditionals.
This allows for complex operations to be encapsulated within the database itself.
