1.  What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that perform a specific task, stored in the database for reuse.
They can accept input parameters, return output parameters, and include programming constructs like loops and conditionals.
This allows for complex operations to be encapsulated within the database itself.

2. Types of Stored Procedures
 - System Stored Procedures: Provided by the database system for administrative tasks. 
 - User-Defined Stored Procedures: Custom procedures created by users to perform specific tasks.
 - Extended Stored Procedures: Allow external programs to be executed from within SQL Server.
 - CLR Stored Procedures: Written in .NET languages and integrated into SQL Server for advanced functionality
	
	
 3. Benefits of Stored Procedures
  - Performance Optimization.
  - Code Reusability and Maintainability.
  - Enhanced Security.
  - Reduced Network Traffic.
	
4. How It Works in a Database:

* Creation: You write the procedure once and store it in the database.

* Storage: The database server compiles and saves it.

* Execution: You call the procedure by name; optionally, pass in parameters.

* Reusability: It can be reused multiple times across applications.

* Security: Users can execute procedures without accessing underlying tables directly.

* Optimization: Stored procedures are parsed and optimized when created, so they often run faster than ad hoc SQL.


5. Structure of a Stored Procedure:


  **1.Name** – Unique name to identify the procedure.

  **2.Parameters** – Accepts input/output parameters (optional).

  **3.Body**  – Contains SQL logic: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.

6. Syntax:

For MySQL (other databases like SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL have similar concepts with slightly different syntax):

      
       DELIMITER //

     CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (
    IN param1 datatype,
    OUT param2 datatype
     )
    BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
     END //

      DELIMITER ;

7. Example:

Stored Procedure to Get Employee Details by Department

    DELIMITER //

     CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment (
    IN dept_id INT
     )
    BEGIN
    SELECT id, name, position FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = dept_id;
     END //

    DELIMITER ;
